My own fucking environment for Mac OS X, mate. It's all in the box. Scripts, themes, dotfiles. It's purely brilliant.

## First time

Everything should be simple, your first step here .too. Copy/paste this line and watch the sky.

```shell
$ curl --silent https://raw.github.com/kud/my/master/scripts/bootstrap | zsh
```

## Periodic run

Install? Update? Well, just one command to make eveeerything.

```shell
$ rocknroll
```
